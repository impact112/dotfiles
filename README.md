# SolidConf

My personal configuration for a complete tiled desktop experience heavily inspired by gnome.

Configurations are included for the following programs:
- hyprland
- hypridle
- hyprlock
- hyprwinwrap
- ags
- foot

Additional dependencies:
- GNU coreutils (GNU sed)
- prettier
- wofi (will be deprecated)

These configs are not to be considered stable and will change sporadicaly.
